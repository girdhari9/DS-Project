## PART 1 - CAUSAL AND ARBITRARY SYSTEM
Start all the clients on different terminals. To broadcast a message simply go to that client terminal and type a message without spaces, then press enter key. That particualar messages will be delivered to all other clients.
### Compile -  
#### To compile server.cpp: 
``` g++ server.cpp -pthread -o server ```

#### To compile client.cpp:
``` g++ client.cpp -pthread -o client ```
### Run -
#### To run server: 
``` ./server [port]  ``` 
example  
``` ./server 8080  ```
 
#### To run client:  
``` ./client [clientid] [port]  ```
#### Example:  
``` ./client 1 8080  ```
``` ./client 2 8080  ```
``` ./client 3 8080  ```

## PART 2 - MUTUAL EXCLUSION ALGORITHM IMPACT  
We have used Suzuki-Kasamiâ€™s algorithm based on causal ordering (i.e Token Based Algorithm)  for implementing distributed Mutual Exclusion. Token-based algorithms are the one in which only one process holding a special message called the token, may enter the critical section.  

#### Types of msg:
1. **IsToken** - a node has finished from critical section and sends the token to next requesting node.   
2. **IsReq** - a node requests to enter in critical section.  
The nodes port numbers are given in ``` config.txt ``` file from which the program matches the it. After running all the nodes in different terminals, the program automatically generates random number for nodes request wait time and shows mutual exclusion.  

### Compile -
``` gcc MutualExclusion.c -lm -lpthread -o MutualExclusion  ```
 (OR)  
``` make  ```

### Run -
###### Node 0  
``` ./MutualExclusion -p 8080  ```
###### Node 1  
``` ./MutualExclusion -p 8081  ```
###### Node 2  
``` ./MutualExclusion -p 8082  ```
###### Node 3  
``` ./MutualExclusion -p 8083  ```
